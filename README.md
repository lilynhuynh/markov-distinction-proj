# Markov Distinction Project
## Overview
This project was developed for CSCI3725 Computation Creativity to show our knowledge of creating a computational-creative system using Markov techniques learned in class.

My program was inspired by the game "_Cuphead_" by Studio MDHR where a boss will have pre-set attacks that become more difficult as the phases increase. Each boss will has a total of 3 phases. I represented this idea with my boss character, **Weiner Dog**. **Weiner Dog** has three phases and its respective attacks:
1. Phase 1 - Normal
    - Slinky Smash: His body extends and smashes to the left
    - Yucky Breath: Like any doggy, they've got a deadly stench!
    - Boing Jump: He bounces like a bouncy ball and smashes on impact
2. Phase 2 - Twisty
    - Extended Chomp: He twists and does a deadly chomp
    - Tail Whip: His tail extends and creates a powerful slash
    - Barrel Roll: Watch out, he creates a donut shape and barrels anyone in his way
3. Phase 3 - Hot Dog
    - Hot Dog: His hot dog buns become mustard and ketchup blasters
    - Plane Dog: His recon plane comes in and sends a flurry of bullets
    - Dancing Hot Dog: He turns on his jams and sends a shockwave with each beat bounce

This program uses **numpy** and **imageio** to compute the randomized probabilities of each attack and generate the gifs respectively. Every **Weiner Dog** animation was hand-drawn by myself.

### Version Control
This project uses Git and GitHub for tracking commits and managing project
development. Please see the GitHub repository for the full development of the application:
https://github.com/lilynhuynh/markov-distinction-proj

## Setup
Please install **numpy** and **imageio** prior to running the program. The markov operations and gif generations will not work properly if not installed beforehand.

## Usage
This program can be accessed by cloning the repository from the provided GitHub link above and running the main.py

Please refer to the **Setup** section before running the program.

## Limitations
During each full fight sequence generation into a gif in the examples folder, it takes a while due to the number of frames it is reading and writing.

## Development
### Personal Impact of System
This system was personally meaningful

- Describe how the system was personally meaningful for you (1 paragraph)
- Explain how working on it genuinely challenged you as a computer scientist (1 paragraph)
    - How did you push yourself outside your comfort zone?
    - Why was this an important challenge for you?
    - What are the next steps for you going forward?
- Discuss whether you believe the system is creative (why or why not)
